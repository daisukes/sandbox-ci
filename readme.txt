- Started from github action tutorial
  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart
- Github action takes a few minutes with minimum lint check
- Found act to run github action locally
  - https://github.com/nektos/act
  - It works on my Apple Silicon Mac Mini
  - exported GITHUB_TOKEN to get rid of the runtime error, but I'm not sure what's different
  - got ERROR in INFO message, but maybe for updating github.com actions page
  ```
ERROR! Failed to call GitHub Status API!
  ```
